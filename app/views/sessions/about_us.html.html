          <h2>Roneesh Vashisht</h2>
          <p>Roneesh's passion for dressing like Jesse Thorn day in and day out spurred him to begin web development, so one day he could create the web application that dressed the world. In the meantime he needs a job, so he and three other cool people are creating a web app that addresses their needs. He sincerely hopes it helps you out too.</p></center>

                    <h2>Brett Hoyer</h2>
          <p>Brett swears the following incantation can raise the dead: Donec sed odio dui. Cras justo odio, dapibus ac facilisis in, egestas eget quam. Vestibulum id ligula porta felis euismod semper. Fusce dapibus, tellus ac cursus commodo, tortor mauris condimentum nibh, ut fermentum massa justo sit amet risus.</p></center>
